## Self-Evaluation: 
(For this assignment, there was 22 exercises checked by 69 automated checks)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:20. I passed all checks with no error and made git commits along the way

## Self-Reflection:
JavaScript is closer to Java than I realized. They share a lot of the same syntax. I also got a nice refresher on objects, as i forgot to call first_name and last_name using this.first_name, and instead tried to pass my function parameters inside the object.
